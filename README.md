An instinctive web application for conducting sentiment analysis on text. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to classify text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative, complete with explanations for the sentiment. It supports three major functionalities: exploring single pieces of text, processing complete files (`.txt` or `.csv`), and comparing the sentiments of two distinct texts side-by-side.

This application is created utilizing Python and leverages the [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) framework for the user interface and the [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) prototype via the [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/) for its analytical power.

‚ú® Features

* üîπ Manual Input: Quickly examine the sentiment of any text by just typing or pasting it into the intake box.
* üìÇ File Upload: Process numerous lines of text at once by uploading a `.txt` file (with each line of text on a new line) or a `.csv` file (using the first column for text). The app supplies a summary of the outcomes in a table and visualizes the sentiment allocation with a pie chart.
* ‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis: Instantly compare the sentiments of two separate pieces of text. The results are shown with individual descriptions and a comparative bar chart.
* ü§ñ AI-Driven Explanations: For every analysis, the app supplies a one-sentence explanation for the given sentiment, presenting deeper insight into the category.
* üìà Data Visualization: Interactive charts from [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) are developed to assist in visualizing the sentiment allocation in your data.
